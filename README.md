# 🎲 Dice Simulator Projects in Python

This GitHub repository contains three different Python programs that simulate a dice roll. Each version shows a different way to create and control randomness.

## 📁 Project Versions

1. **GUI Dice Simulator**
   - Uses Tkinter to display dice faces as images in a graphical window.
   - You can click a button to roll the dice.
   
2. **Normal Dice Simulator**
   - A simple text-based dice program using `random.randint()`.
   - Runs in the terminal.

3. **Biased Dice Simulator**
   - Similar to the normal version, but it's biased so that 6 appears more often.
   - Useful for learning about probability and weighting in code.

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ Simulates rolling a 6-sided dice
- 🖼️ GUI version displays real dice images using Tkinter
- 🎯 Biased version increases the chance of rolling a 6
- 📜 Simple code structure, easy for beginners
- 📁 Organized into clean folders for clarity
- 🧪 Great for understanding randomness and probability

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes with most Python installations)
- Dice face images (for GUI version only):
  - Named as: `image 1.png`, `image 2.png`, ..., `image 6.png`

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

```bash
To run the GUI Dice Simulator, navigate to the 1_GUI_Dice_Simulator folder and run: python gui_dice_simulator.py.  
For the normal dice simulator, go to 2_Normal_Dice_Simulator and run: python normal_dice.py.  
To try the biased version, go to 3_Biased_Dice_Simulator and run: python biased_dice.py.
